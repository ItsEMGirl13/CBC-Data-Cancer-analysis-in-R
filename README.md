🧬 Cancer Detection Analysis Using CBC Data
🔍 Overview
This project leverages CBC data to explore if hematologic markers—PLT, HGB, HCT, and PDW—can aid in cancer detection using a logistic regression model.

📊 Key Insights
Model Performance: AUC of 0.91, reflecting strong ability to distinguish cases.
Significance: Predictors showed weak statistical significance (p > 0.05) but highlight promising patterns.
No Multicollinearity: VIF = 1 for all predictors, ensuring clear, independent analysis.
